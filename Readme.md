# Formatted city information
This project is based on exercises 11.1 and 11.2 from the Python Crash Course book. It is a good example on how to create a test file.
> I would like to emphasize that in the `test.py` file I had to include the code bellow inside the `TestClass` but out of the methods (see the file `test_city_country` for better understanding):
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
